# Module 1:Understanding Servers


##### What You'll Learn

This module will help you gain a basic understanding of the Internet, specifically about servers, hosts, file transfers, and your MSU-provided AFS space.

##### What You'll Produce
You will produce a Microsoft Word document in which you answer a series of questions about the readings. You will then upload that document to your AFS space and then email me a link to where I can access that file on the Internet.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Read / watch the following:**
  * [What is a Web Host?](http://www.w3schools.com/website/web_host_intro.asp)
  * [What is a Web Host?](https://youtu.be/HrOnrephOlE)
  * [What is FTP?](https://youtu.be/Spg0JFLc3KI)
  * [MSU AFS Space](http://techbase.msu.edu/article.asp?id=2394&service=techbase)

2. **Create a Microsoft Word document in which you answer the following questions:**
  * What are the 3 basic technologies needed to run a website?
  * What are local files, what are web servers, what is FTP and how are they related?
  * What is AFS Space and what does it allow you to do?
  * What is the URL for the web space MSU provides for you in your AFS space?

3. **[Download and install Filezilla.](https://filezilla-project.org)** Go to the Filezilla website and download the most recent version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, etc). Once you've installed Filezilla, use [these MSU-provided instructions](http://techbase.msu.edu/article.asp?id=6845&service=techbase) to configure Filezilla to connect to your AFS space. Read the complete tutorial for details on how Filezilla lets you move files between your computer and a server.

4. **Save your Word document as a .pdf.** Name your file module1.pdf - no spaces, no special characters (!@#$%^&*). When you've saved the file, use Filezilla to upload it to your AFS space. Be sure and upload it to your web folder so it'll be accessible on the Internet. After the file has completed uploading, make sure you can access the file using a web browser. The link should look like http://msu.edu/~YOURNETID/module1.pdf

5. **To submit Module 1:** edit the link for Module 1 on your course page to the link above.
