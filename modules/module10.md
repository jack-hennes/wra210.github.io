# Module 10: Separation of Content from Design


##### What You'll Learn

You will analyze both the markup you’ve developed so far and the CSS you’re written to style that markup. You will reflect on how well you’ve implemented strategies to separate your content from your presentation, or the degree to which your content contains presentational information that could / should be removed.

##### What You'll Produce
You will produce a 1 page report that reflects on the current state of your portfolio development and outlines the work you’ll do to improve the separation or what you’ll continue to do to ensure that your final product is a complete separation of the two.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Analyze your markup and your CSS.** View the source of all of the HTML documents you’ve produced so far and assess how well you have (or haven’t) managed to separate content from presentation.

2. **Summarize your findings.** Write a 1-page report about your practices thus far. What were you deliberately doing up to this point to keep content and presentation separated? Where did you find shortcomings in your markup? What will you do differently going forward to ensure that your markup is clean and free of presentational information?

3. **Save your report as an HTML document (filename.html) and upload to your AFS space and into your course folder.** Alternatively, save your report as a markdown document (filename.md) and upload to your AFS space. Do not submit a Microsoft Word document – at this point, you should be prepared to easily produce a simple HTML document. Save your report as an HTML document with proper, standards-compliant markup to your AFS space and link to it from your course page.
