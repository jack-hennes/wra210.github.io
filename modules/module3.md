# Module 3: PW Alumni Interview Report


##### What You'll Learn

Understanding the purpose, audience, and conventions of a website is an essential design process and it is difficult to arrive at this understanding without doing some research. In this module you will develop your research skills and interview a graduate of either the Professional Writing undergraduate degree or the Digital Rhetoric and Professional Writing graduate program about their portfolios and what they look for in portfolios of people applying for jobs.

This interview will take place during a class via video-conference with select alumni who will answer your questions. After going over your results from Module 2, we will crowdsource a collection of questions for the respondents. Note: the alumni selected for this module are not to be used for the CRAP exercise in Module 2. However, be familiar with their portfolios when it comes time to creating and asking questions.

##### What You'll Produce
You will produce a report of the interviews in which you include the questions asked, their answers, and an analysis of what you learned. You'll upload your reports to your AFS space and link it from your course homepage. The questions and answers for everyone will basically be the same, but your ability to distill what you learned, combined with your analysis from Module 2, will separate your response from each other.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Develop your interview questions.** Build your list of questions, using our in-class conversation as a starting point, and upload them into the shared Google Doc for the class to discuss. Remember that you are trying to understand what portfolios do, the choices the interviewees made when building theirs, what they learned in building their portfolios, and what they might wish they'd known when they were in your shoes.
2. **Get your answers.** As the interviews will occur via video-conference, you will need to record or transcribe the interview for accuracy.
3. **Synthesize your responses.** Summarize what you took away from the interviews, including the major points and ideas that you a) want to report back to the class, and 2) will use when you start to design your own portfolio.
4. **Write your report.** Be sure to include a complete list of questions asked, a summary of responses received, and your analysis.
5. **Upload your document (.pdf) to your AFS space.** Put your completed report in your AFS space and update your course pages to link to it.
