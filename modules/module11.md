# Module 11: SCRUM Report 


##### What You'll Learn

You will reflect on the work done during the last four session in which you were developing your portfolios. You will describe your experience in your scrum teams, both as someone who was helping your team members and as someone who received support from your team. You will also describe how you used your workshop time and identify important resources, both human and online, that helped you solve problems.

##### What You'll Produce
You will produce a 1-2 page report that reflects on your experiences in your scrum team and your workshop time. This report will serve as your accountability for your time spent in workshop.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Write about your experience in your scrum team.** As a team member, you were supposed to use your group to get support for your work but also to provide support to your group members. What kinds of questions and obstacles did you bring to your group, and how helpful was the group in providing answers? What kinds of support did you give to your group members, and did that help them overcome their obstacles? How did you (or didn’t you) learn to ask effective questions to get better help? Be specific, including resources you may have referred group members to.

2. **Write about your time spent in the workshops.** How effectively did you spend the time given to you to develop your portfolio in class? What are some of the goals you set for yourself? How successful were you in achieving those goals?

3. **Where did you get support?** One of they key skills you’ll need to be a web designer is knowing where to go to get assistance when you encounter problems. For this project, what resources did you rely on to get support? If you got help from another human, who and in what capacity? If you got help online, what specific resources did you use? Include links whenever possible, especially if you posted a question (or found an existing answer) on a forum like StackExchange.

4. **Save your report as an HTML document and upload to your AFS space.** Do not submit a Microsoft Word document – at this point, you should be prepared to easily produce an HTML document. Save your report as an HTML document with proper, standards-compliant markup to your AFS space and link to it from your course page.
