# Module 9: WayBackMachine Redesign


##### What You'll Learn

At the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/web/), over 240 billion screenshots of web pages have been archived. The WayBackMachine helps you search for specific sites on the internet to experience and participate in the history of the digital domain. You will observe that websites change over a period of decades, years, and months in a manner that is dictated by audience and available technology - you will need to think rhetorically about the site you study and your redesign. It is important to note that design elements of pages continue to evolve, and sites from the early to mid-2000s look noticeably different than they do now.

##### What You'll Produce
You will be placed into groups where you will explore the Internet Archive, find a website of your choosing, and redesign the website via the design elements we have been discussing in this class over the course of the semester. Focus on creating a new landing page and sitemap to explain the intricacies and reasons for your new design.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Go to the Internet Archive and select a website.** After finding a website your group agrees to analyze, take a screenshot. Feel free to search for older or other variations of the website.

2. **Think about design.** Going back over your own designs of your portfolios and the CRAP principles, begin to assess the siteâ€™s usability, accessibility, and sustainability.

3. **Begin redesigning the site.** You can use any of the materials in the class to create paper versions of your redesign or use digital spaces for such a task. You will be working together in groups, so use whatever space is best for you all, not just one of you.

4. **Collecting your design and analysis.** You can take pictures of your paper mockups or begin collecting digital versions.

5. **Upload your work to your AFS space.** Put everything in a single .pdf file - it should contain screenshots of the original website, your redesigns, and your reflection on your redesign choices. When complete, be sure to include the names of your group members and then upload the .pdf to each of your personal AFS spaces.
