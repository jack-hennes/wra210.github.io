# Module 7: Design Comps Reflection (Usability and Revision Report)


##### What You'll Learn

At this point we've spent several weeks on design - you've created initial designs, usability tested them with classmates, and taken what you learned from testing and revised your designs. Here you'll reflect back on the design process and discuss what you learned from usability, how your designs changed as a result of what you learned, and what (if anything) you'll carry forward in future design work.

##### What You'll Produce
You will produce a short report summarizing the results of your usability test, the changes you made, and your reflection.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Summarize what you learned from the usability process.** What did your classmates (your users) tell you that you hadn't considered? What kind of feedback did they give you on your design choices? On your information architecture? What assumptions did they agree with and which did they challenge?

2. **Summarize your revisions.** What feedback did you utilize in your revisions? What did you disregard? How substantial were your revisions?

3. **Reflect on the process and how you might design in the future.** 
  * Did you find usability/review helpful? Why or why not? 
  * Did you learn anything about graphic design from your test group? 
  * How might your design choices in the future be influenced by what you learned from your group? 
  * Also, think about your usability test of others - what did you learn by reviewing the work of your classmates that might be helpful for you going forward?

4. **Upload your document to your AFS Space**. Save your report as a .pdf, upload it to your AFS space, and update your course page accordingly.
