# Module 6: Design Comps


##### What You'll Learn

You will learn the basics of using graphic design software. Specifically, you'll learn how layers work, how color and type work, and how to save your designs as editable, layered files.

##### What You'll Produce
You'll use two template files to produce a color and type guide for your portfolio that you will save as layered graphic files. You will also produce a full design comp for your portfolio that demonstrates a fully-realized graphic design for your portfolio site, building off of wireframes created in Module 5.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Select a color scheme for your portfolio site.** Determine the colors you'll use for your design. Select complimentary colors that will be utilized across your site and be sure to select enough colors to make achieve sufficient contrast between objects. If you're unsure how to combine colors, consider using one of these tools: [Colorate](http://www.colorotate.org/), [Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/), or [Pictaculous](http://www.pictaculous.com/).

2. **Create a color palette reference guide.** Using Photoshop (or your preferred graphic editor), open and edit the [palette template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kyc0f7c9ixpxlla/color-palette.psd) and modify the colors to illustrate your color scheme. Save the template when you finish, making sure to save as a PSD file.

3. **Select the typefaces for your portfolio site.** Choose which typefaces you want to use for your site. Remember to use some contrast in your selection, but also remember that you don't want to use too many fonts in your design (consistency!). For the purposes of this exercise, only use one of the 16 web-safe fonts to make sure that you can display them in your AFS space.

4. **Create a typographic reference guide.** Using Photoshop, open and edit the [typeface template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i8psbs4jambqo69/typecard.psd) and modify the text blocks accordingly to reflect the different types of text. Use color where appropriate. When you finish, save the guide as a PSD file.

5. **Develop a full design comp for your landing page.** Using the Photoshop skills you've learned to develop the landing page for your portfolio site. You can (and should) use the [960 Grid](http://960.gs/) as a guide when creating your design. Use the wireframe you created for Module 5 as a guide, and make sure that the comp reflects all of the materials you laid out as requirements. Also, be sure to use the color and typography guides you developed in this exercise to implement your design. When you're done, be sure to save your comps as a PSD file.

6. **Develop comps for the rest of your interfaces.** Make design comps for each of the wireframes you created for Module 5. Keep in mind that many elements may be recycled between comps (headers, footers, background, images, text, etc) but each comp should be saved as a separate document.

7. **Write a brief explanation of your design decisions.** Briefly describe your design choices, particularly in terms of color, typography, and any images you chose to use. Also name any designs you saw that influenced you (program alums, other sites). Compose this in Word and save your document.

8. **Upload everything to your AFS space.** Be sure to link to everything on your course page (guides, all comps, rationale).
