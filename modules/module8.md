# Module 8: Server File Organizaton (Website Organization)


##### What You'll Learn

In this module you will gain experience organizing files and folders inside a web server in a way that will make it easier for users to find files and for you (the site architect) to create links back and forth between those files.

##### What You'll Produce
You will arrange all of the materials you've produced and uploaded to your AFS space for this class so far into a well-organized set of files and folders. You will then update your course homepage to link to the new, better-organized locations for those files.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Determine how to organize your files.** Analyze the content of your AFS space. What's in there? What else will be added, according to the syllabus? How might it be effectively organized?

2. **Create your folder structure.** Create however many new folders are necessary to organize your content, based on your analysis in step 1. Be sure to follow best practices for naming folders.

3. **Rename and move files as needed.** With your new folders in place, drag the existing files into them as necessary. Make sure that they are named according to best practices.

4. **Update your course homepage.** With your files now renamed (maybe) and re-organized into folders (definitely), update the links on your course homepage to point to the new locations for the appropriate files. Make sure that the links direct the browser into the right folders. Be sure to test the links after you publish your updates.

5. **Save your changes.** Write brief summary of what you did and why. Save this reflection as a .pdf and update your course page with a link to this .pdf for Module 8.
